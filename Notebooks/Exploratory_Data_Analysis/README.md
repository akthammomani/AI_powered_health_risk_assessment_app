## Introduction

Welcome to the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) notebook for our heart disease prediction project. This notebook serves as a critical step in our data science workflow, aimed at uncovering insights and patterns within our dataset that will guide our predictive modeling efforts.

In this notebook, we will:

* Validate the Dataset: Ensure the data is clean, consistent, and ready for analysis.
* Explore Feature Distributions: Analyze the distribution of various features in relation to heart disease.
* Convert Categorical Data: Transform categorical features into numeric format using CatBoost encoding for better analysis and modeling.
* Analyze Correlations: Examine both linear and non-linear relationships between features and the target variable (heart disease) using Pearson correlation and mutual information.
* Feature Selection: Identify and select key features that have the most predictive power for heart disease.
* 
These steps will help us understand the data better, reveal important relationships, and prepare the data for building robust predictive models.
